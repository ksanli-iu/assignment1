**Q1.** Please assign values to 5 different variables each corresponding to a different basic data type that exist in the Python language. Please pay attention for the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) conventions in choosing variable names!

**Q2.** Assign variables to the individual components of your favourite gene (e.g promoter, 5' UTR, start codon, exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 3' UTR). Print the entire gene by using the string concatenation operator on the standard output! Note: Feel free to create a fictional gene sequence by randomly filling in the components.
